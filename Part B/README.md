* pretrained_model.py - Contains Class Definitions for defining the pretrained model and finetuning parameters
* inference.py - For Loading and Doing Inference in the test Dataset
* preprocess.py - Contains Function to preprocess the Datasets

## Folders

* model_dir - Directory which Contains the Model files

## Example

The below code in the terminal runs with the default hyperparameter which gave the best result
```
python3 train.py 
```
