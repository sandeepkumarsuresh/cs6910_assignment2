10 classes in train and test folder
train ->10 classes -> 1000 images -> 800 x 600 pixels

Images are not of same size --> Therefore need to resize them

pip install split-folders

While coding the CustomDataset class
                data_transforms = transforms.Compose([
                    transforms.ToPILImage(),   --> takes PIL Image to Convert
                    transforms.Resize((self.img_dims)),
                    transforms.ToTensor(),
                    transforms.Normalize(mean=(0.5, 0.5,0.5), std=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
                ])


last_layer * (H // (stride**len(layers))) * (W // (stride**len(layers)))


# TODO

    ~ figure out why validation acc is more than the training acc
    ~ Make a class for the train validation 
    ~ Integrate wandb and run the sweeep
    
Done Tasks:

    Add batchnorm and droupout -> done
    Made CNN.py into class like sdtructure
    made test.py into function like structure
    Added Data augmentation
    Added wandb

TODO

    -CNN formula based on kernel size , padding to CNN.py
    -model saving
